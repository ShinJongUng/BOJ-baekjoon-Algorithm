<h2>Under description</h2>

<h4>We solved the problem by dividing the input value by 20000303 from the first digit and then multiplying it by 10, then passing it over to the second digit, and then multiplying it by 10 and then passing it over to the third digit. If this is not the case and you use int-type variables, you cannot solve the problem by timeout.</h4>
